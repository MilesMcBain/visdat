\usage{
vis_guess(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a data.frame object}
}
\description{
\code{vis_guess} just like vis_dat, vis_guess gives you an at-a-glance ggplot object of what is inside a dataframe. Except this time, vis_guess uses `readr` to help it guess what the individual cells are. These cells are coloured according to what class they are and whether the values are missing. As \code{vis_guess} returns a ggplot object, it is very easy to customize. Currently very slow.
}
\details{
\code{vis_guess} visualises a data.frame like vis_dat, but takes a guess at to telling you what it contains.
}
\examples{
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(visdat)

vis_guess(example2)

dat_messy <-
  example2 \%>\%
  mutate(capacity = ifelse(capacity <= 60500,
                           yes = "2010/10/10",
                           no = capacity))

vis_guess(dat_messy)
